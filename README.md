Abstract:

Question Answering (QA) is a type of Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that requires models to answer questions by extracting information from given passages of text. ELECTRA small is a model that uses self-supervised language representation learning to complete QA tasks. While this model works exceptionally well with the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), a reading comprehension data set derived from Wikipedia articles, it is unable to perform well on real-life data sets. In this particular paper, we are increasing model performance on Adversarial, Negation and Contrast Question Answer Sets (ANC). We modified the SQuAD data to ANC formats and used it to train and test on the modified ELECTRA small model to capture changes in accuracy. Our evaluation results show a performance improvement of 8.4% compared to the baseline of training on a combination of auto generated data.
